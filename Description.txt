(Possible list of abilities)
Abilities:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Name: Divide			| Cast type: No target
{
Description:
Divides self into two lesser spirits of the caster with halved attributes. The lesser versions can 
cast "Divide" to create minor spirits. The spirits are clones but can't use items, though they will 
benefit from any passive effects. The spirits can use runes. If one spirit dies, the caster regains 
the attributes of the fallen spirit but does not heal back the health or mana. If a spirit merges 
with another, their attributes add up and their current healths are merged. Base attributes are also
reduced with the exception of movement speed. If one spirit remains, the Water Spirit is restored. 
Lesser spirits are indistinguishable from the main spirit. Grants gold bounty based on the % of 
attributes compared to the original spirit.
